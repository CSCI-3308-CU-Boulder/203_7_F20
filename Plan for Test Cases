User Acceptance Tests:

1) Signup Page (* I’m not sure what functions are doing the checks, so I just put [function] instead)
Test Cases: when a user uses an invalid username, when a user uses a valid
username, when the user uses an invalid password/doesn’t meet the criteria, when the
username a user chooses is already taken, when the username is not chosen already, if
one of the required fields is not filled, if they have not checked off the terms and
conditions agreement, if the passwords do not match
  a) When a user uses an invalid username (has an invalid character) - the [function]
  will check to make sure that all of the characters used in the name are valid
  characters
  b) When a user uses a valid username - when they click the “Submit” button, the
  username and information will populate in the database, so no one else can have
  the same username
  c) When the user uses an invalid password - the [function] will check to see if all the
  characters in the password are valid or not. If they are not then the user will not
  be able to use that password for their account. Additionally, if the password does
  not meet all the criteria, then the user won’t be able to use that password for their
  account
  d) When the username a user chooses is already taken - when the user tries to
  complete the sign-up process, the [function] will check if the username is already
  in the database, and if it is, the user will have to choose a different username
  e) If one of the required fields is not filled - if they try to click the submit button the
  “required” tag in the form will not allow the user to submit the form without filling
  out all of the required fields
  f) If they have not checked off the Terms and Conditions agreement - if the user
  tries to finish the sign-up process but has not checked of the checkbox that
  indicates they read the Terms and Conditions (no one does though), then they
  will be notified that they didn’t check it off
  g) If the passwords do not match - the [function] will check and see if the passwords
  match, and it they don’t then the user cannot complete the sign-up process
  
2) Login Page
Test Cases: when a user’s login information is correct, if the user’s username is
incorrect, if the user’s password is incorrect, if the user has not signed up yet and tries
to use the login page
  a) If the user has an invalid username, the username inputted will be checked
  against the username stored in the database. The user will have to try different
  usernames until every character matches the characters in the database.
  b) If the user has an invalid password, the password inputted will be checked
  against the password stored in the database. The user will have to try different
  passwords until every character matches the characters in the database.
  c) If the user has not signed up yet, it will check in the database to see if the
  username and password exists. If the credentials do not exist, then the user will
  be prompted to create an account on the signup page.
  
3) User Profile Page
Test Cases: when the user wants to change their name, when the user wants to change
their username, if the user wants to change their password, if the username they chose
is taken, if they want to update their profile picture
  a) If the user wants to change their username to a username that is already taken, they
  should be unable to submit the form and an error should be displayed.
  b) If the user wants to change their username to a username that is not already taken, the
  username should be updated in the database so that login verification works with the
  new username.
  c) If the user wants to change their password, the new password will not submit to the
  database until the old password is entered correctly and the new password matches
  criteria (length, contains a number, etc.)
  d) If the user changes any other information, the data should be sent to the database so
  that the new information is loaded when the user logs in again.
